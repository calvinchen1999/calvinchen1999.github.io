            <h2>1. We collect information in a few different ways:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>a. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it</li>
                <li>b. We also get technical information when you use DeCign</li>
                <li>c. Our partners and advertisers share information with us</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2. What we do with the info we collect:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We use the information we collect to provide the Service to you. We commit to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. In order to do that, it’s necessary for us to use your information to identify you when you use DeCign, and process your transactions. We recommend Pins, boards, topics or categories you might like based on your activity on DeCign. For example, if we see you’re into cooking, we may suggest food-related Pins, boards or people that we think you might like or show you food-related ads.</li>
                <li>In addition and for similar reasons, we have a legitimate interest in using your information in these ways. It is also fundamental to the nature of the Service we provide. In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make the Service relevant, interesting and personal to you like we promised, and it’s in both of our interests for us to do that.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>4. Choices you have about your info:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>DeCign is a worldwide service. By using DeCign, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>3. Transferring your information:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information. If you have a DeCign account, many of the choices you have on DeCign are built directly into DeCign or your settings. Also, we support the Do Not Track browser setting and you can learn more about how it affects our collection and use of offsite data. You also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access DeCign.</li>
